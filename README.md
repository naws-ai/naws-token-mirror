# NAWS Token
Welcome to the NAWS Token repository. NAWS is a secure, transparent, and governance-driven token that follows the EIP-20 standard, ensuring it's compatible with the EVM ecosystem.

## Overview
NAWS is designed with a focus on security, transparency, and decentralization. Itâ€™s built to be a solid token for governance and other dApps, with no compromises on safety or integrity.

## Key Features
- EIP-20 Compliance: Fully compatible with Ethereum wallets and dApps, ensuring smooth interactions and integration across platforms.

- Fixed Supply: NAWS has a hard cap of 10 billion tokens. No more tokens will ever be minted, ensuring scarcity and protecting against inflation.

- Cold Wallet Management: Security first. NAWS tokens are stored in cold wallets, reducing risks of unauthorized access and hacks.

- Snapshot Functionality: Built-in snapshot functionality allows the network to log token balances at specific block heights. Essential for governance, airdrops, and other community events.

- Security and Transparency: We prioritize transparency and security. NAWS uses proven cryptographic methods to secure all transactions on the blockchain. Cold wallet storage adds an extra layer of protection.
